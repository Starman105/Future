# Future 🎉

Welcome to the **Future** project! 🚀 This Python project calculates your future age. 🌟

## How It Works 🤔

1. The program asks for your name. 📝
2. It greets you with a friendly message. 👋
3. Then, it asks for your current age. 🎂
4. Finally, it calculates and tells you how old you will be in ten years! 📅

## Getting Started 🛠️

To get started, simply run the Python script. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. 🐍

## Example Usage 💻

```python
python future.py
Output Example

Code
Enter your name: John
Hello, John!
How old are you? 25
In ten years, you will be 35 years old! 🎉
Feel free to try it out and see how old you will be in the future! 🔮
